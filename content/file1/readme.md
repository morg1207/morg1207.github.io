# Bica

This project was developed in the course of microcontrollers. The project consisted of developing a robot that could solve mazes, be used as a remote control car and be controlled by gestures.

For each mode the robot uses something for achieve the goal:
- For the maze mode, the robot uses a ultrasonic sensor to detect the free path.
- For the remote control mode, the robot uses a radio frequency module to receive the commands.
- For the gesture mode, the robot uses an analog accelerometer to detect the gestures.
solve mazes.

Here is a gif demonstration of the project:
