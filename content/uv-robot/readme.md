# UV Robot: Autonomous Disinfection Prototype for Hospitals

### Project Overview
The UV Robot is a comprehensive prototype developed to automate and enhance disinfection processes within hospital environments. This autonomous mobile robot utilizes ultraviolet (UV) light to efficiently disinfect rooms and high-touch surfaces, aiming to reduce healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and minimize human exposure to both pathogens and harsh chemicals.

### My Role: Project Lead
I had the privilege of leading this project from conception through to its current implementation phase. My responsibilities encompassed the entire system architecture and integration, including:

*   **Hardware Design & Integration:** Spearheading the selection and integration of all physical components, including the mobile base, UV-C lamp arrays, sensors, and control units.
*   **Software System Development:** Architecting and overseeing the development of the core software stack responsible for robot control and functionality.
*   **Application Layer:** Designing the user interface (UI/UIX) and the application logic that allows hospital staff to initiate and monitor disinfection cycles easily.
*   **Autonomous Navigation:** Leading the implementation of the autonomous navigation system, including mapping, path planning, and obstacle avoidance, enabling the robot to move safely and efficiently without human intervention.
*   **Implementation & Deployment:** Currently managing the ongoing real-world testing and deployment strategy to ensure reliability and effectiveness in a live hospital setting.
