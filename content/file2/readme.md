# Orange quality control (deep learning)

My team applied transfer learning to pre-trained models to classify the madurity of oranges. This project was part of the final project for digital image processing course and we used Matlab.

Here are some pictures of the results of the project:

- The first image shows the architecture of the AlexNet model.

- The second image shows the architecture of the GoogleNet model.

- The third image shows the architecture of the ResNet model.

At the end of the project, we chose the ResNet model because it had the best performance. The model was able to classify the maturity of the oranges with an accuracy of 96.4%.
