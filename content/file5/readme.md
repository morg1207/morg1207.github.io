# Escalerini

Many buildings in LATAM do not have elevators, it generates a big
problem for people who have to carry products to their homes and have
physical problems. ESCALERINI is an autonomous robot that can carry
products up to 20 kg to the homes of people who live in buildings
without elevators. This robot uses 2 locomotion subsystems, one for
hallways and another for stairs.

## Objectives

This paper proposes an autonomous robot that can carry home products up to 20 kg through straight stairs. The specific objectives of the project focused on the following design requirements:

- Ergonomic design for user to load and unload products
- User ease of use
- Control system to follow trajectories
- Design suitable for going up and down straight stairs

## Features

- Maximum volume of products: 43.49 dmÂ³
- Robot size: 75.5 x 79 x 55 cm (H x L x W) when it is in ergonomic position
- Maximum payload: 20 kg
- Maximum speed: 0.75 m/s
- Autonomy: 3 hours
- Security system:
  - Internal scale
  - Emergency stop button
  - Proximity sensors
- Vision system: RGBD
- Suitable algorithms for each type of motion

Here are some demonstrative videos of the project:
