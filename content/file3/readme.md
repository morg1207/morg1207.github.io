# Loom inspector

- I was part of and later led the team in charge of automating the process of visual inspection of looms through computer vision.
- I programmed the 1st Omron linear camera in LATAM for the acquisition of 2D images of the looms.
- I developed with the team a software for the operators to register the data required by the project.
- I used Convolutional Neural Networks for the detection of defects in looms.
- I made a PLC and PC work together to automate the inspection process, which involved controlling the machine, recording defects and also physically marking the loom.
- The AI model learned to correctly detect 5 types of defects with greater than 95% accuracy.

Here is a video demonstration of the assembly of the project:
