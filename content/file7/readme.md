# Amigus

The pandemic has made everybody stay studying at home, but also there have always been isolated people who need a little push to study or interact with others. AMIGUS is a social robot that helps with good companionship, motivational messages and tasks during the times when students are dealing with online classes.

Here are some demonstrative videos of the project:

## Features

Amigus will help to encourage students according to what they express. The highlights are listed below:

- **Mental health**: To help emotional and social well-being, the robot offers companionship and avoids isolation of the user.
- **Emotion identification**: The user can submit their emotional state through buttons or gesture recognition and receive empathetic eye expressions. The buttons available are for happiness, sadness, nervousness, and one to put the robot to sleep.
- **Encouraging recordings**: These expressions will be answered with audios taken from movies or phrases. In this way, depending on the emotion, a different audio will be played from a list per emotion.
- **Stimulates communication**: Some different questions can be asked by the robot during the day in order to generate self-knowledge. It also asks about how you are or common questions from every day when there was no pandemic.
- **Trustworthy companion**: It is important to do different activities apart from studying, so the robot encourages you to call or write to your friends. Also, you can play with it by rubbing its back or head.
