# RB1 Masterclass Project: Autonomous Warehouse Robot

## Project Overview
This project was developed as the final assignment for The Construct's Masterclass, featuring a RB1 robot with a built-in lifting platform, capable of performing complete warehouse automation tasks. The system implements a behavior tree-based autonomy architecture to locate shelves, utilize the existing lifting mechanism for pick and unload operations, and includes a web application interface for task management and monitoring.

## My Role: Autonomy & Integration Developer
I designed and implemented the complete autonomous operation system, focusing on:

- **Behavior Tree Architecture:** Developed the core decision-making system using behavior trees for task execution
- **Navigation System:** Implemented autonomous navigation and shelf localization
- **Web Application Integration:** Built the frontend-backend system for user interaction and monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture
- **Framework:** ROS 2 (Robotic Operating System 2)
- **Autonomy System:** Behavior Trees for decision making and task sequencing
- **Navigation:** ROS 2 Navigation Stack with customized behavior plugins
- **Platform Control:** Integration and control of existing lifting mechanism

### Web Application Layer
- **Frontend:** React.js-based dashboard for task management
- **Backend:** ROSBridge integration for robot-web communication
- **Features:** Real-time monitoring, task initiation, and status reporting

### Key Capabilities
1. **Environment Exploration:** Autonomous mapping and shelf searching
2. **Shelf Localization:** Detection and positioning of target shelves
3. **Lifting Integration:** Control of existing platform mechanism for loading/unloading
4. **Transport System:** Safe navigation and shelf transportation
5. **User Control:** Web-based task management interface
